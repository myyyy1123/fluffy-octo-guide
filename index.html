    <h1>Teen Rescued After Storm at Sea</h1>
    <p><strong>Lara Moore</strong>, 18, was caught in a sudden storm while sailing. Knocked unconscious by her boat during the storm, she later awoke stranded and soaked.</p>
    <p>Despite the chaos, she managed to call her mother—22 km away—after waiting for her wet map to dry. With only 9% battery, she shared her location and awaited rescue.</p>
    <blockquote>
      "I was waiting for what seemed like hours in the middle of the sea," Lara said. "I was about to give up hope when I heard the sound of a helicopter."
    </blockquote>
    <p>She was hospitalized with a concussion but expected to recover fully. The rescue team reminded sailors not to go off-piste due to rising storm risks. “Lara had a lucky escape,” they said.</p>
